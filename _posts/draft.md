Several months ago remote sensing world are struck by the one of google deepmind massive project in the space which is the official release of google satelite embedings. Few hours after the official launch im reading the white paper and test theh data myself and left speechless by the sheer awesomeness of the data. Im also lucky enough to get a seat in Geo for Good 2025 Summit in Singapore where they introduce the dataset and showcase few of it capabilities. Most remote sensing scinetist that lieks to express their opinion online already give some comentary. As I fit in that category, I will briefly write about it here.

To be fair, the oncapet of embedings is not entirely new. even in remote sensing space, several reserach groups already created embedings dataset from their satelite data to represent the earth surface better in some sense.

However, scale of the data input and global coverage of goo gle embedings made it one of a kind dataset for remote sensing. There are a lot of very good technical explanation about what satelite embedings is and how they are produced. some of it you can read here and here. but to put it simply, I just think of embedings as PCA on steroids. 

In the carbon project space, accurate and timely land cover model is essential input for modelling, and also for operational and managerial decision.
