One of the main characteristics of hyperspectral imagery is its high-dimensional data (i.e., a high number of spectral bands). This type of data, while providing a higher level of detail in the spectral characteristics of the material we observe, also raises challenges in handling the data effectively. Higher dimensional data means it becomes more challenging to extract meaningful information for analysis. These challenges are often referred to as [the curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality). 

In this post, I will show my approach in conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a hyperspectral imagery with the goal of deriving meaningful geological information from the data. In this post, we will assume no geological prior knowledge of the region (although nowadays that is hardly the case, especially for Earth's surface). We will rely solely on the hyperspectral data itself and some basic spectrometry and geology knowledge.

We will use an airborne hyperspectral image covering the shortwave infrared range (SWIR) from ~2000 nm to ~2400 nm over an area of about 10 kmÂ² in an arid region. All of the analysis performed in this post is done using standard scientific libraries in the Python environment and an open-source software called [Hyppy](http://hyppy.is-great.org/?i=1) developed at the University of Twente.

## 1. Basic visualization

The obvious first step in EDA of hyperspectral imagery is to visualize the image. We can choose to visualize the image in grayscale for selected wavelength bands of interest and create false color composites to observe the main structural characteristics of the region. 

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid 
        path="assets/img/post_4_composite.png" 
        class="img-fluid rounded" 
        alt="False color composite image of an arid terrain generated using three SWIR bands (Red: 2088 nm, Green: 2199 nm, Blue: 2328 nm). The image highlights geological features such as lineaments and varying lithologies. The composite enhances mineralogical and structural differences, useful for initial remote sensing interpretation."

<div class="caption">
    Image 1. False color composite image (R: 2088 nm; G: 2199 nm; B: 2328 nm)
</div>

My initial interpretation of the region is that it is most likely mainly composed of sedimentary bedding influenced by a fault with apparent left-lateral movement, based on the drag fold formed along the fault lines.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">

            alt="Image of annotated version of the false color composite showing interpreted geological features.

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

When it comes to mineralogical/geological interpretations, I find it helpful to begin with a very broad interpretation. Knowing that the region is likely predominantly composed of sedimentary rocks already provides significant constraints for further interpretation, which may be very useful in the next phase. We may revisit this interpretation later if further analysis or data does not support it.


## 2. Getting to know the data

It is very important to familiarize ourselves with the data we are working with. At this stage, I typically inspect the spectra of some pixels that stand out in the visualization and get a sense of the variation in spectral responses present in the image. For this, I often use specialized software such as [ENVI](https://www.nv5geospatialsoftware.com/Products/ENVI), [QGIS with Spectral Profile Plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/temporalprofiletool/), or [Hyppy](http://hyppy.is-great.org/?i=1). The later two is an open source program which are available for free. 

At this stage, we can also plot a histogram of the mean reflectance values of the image to see how many visible clusters are present across the spectral bands. Note that the reflectance value are in the sacale of 10,000.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid 
            path="assets/img/post_4_mean_histogram.png" 
            class="img-fluid rounded" 
            alt="Image of histogram displaying the mean reflectance value of each pixel in the hyperspectral image. The horizontal axis shows reflectance (in scale of 10,000), and the vertical axis shows frequency of occurrence. Two distinct peaks indicate two main pixel groups, corresponding to low- and high-albedo surface materials."

        %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Image 3. Histogram of mean albedo of each pixel in the image showing two main albedo class.
</div>

From the histogram, we can decide on a threshold to classify our pixels based on their average albedo. This is generally equivalent to classifying the image into bright-colored minerals and dark-colored minerals (albeit in the shortwave infrared range, not in the visible range). Typically, low-albedo minerals in SWIR also appear dark in visible light. Our first classification results are shown below which shows the most basic classification of the image we have: reflective vs absortive minerals.

            class="img-fluid rounded" 
            alt="This image shows binary classification map derived from average reflectance values in the SWIR range. Pixels are classified into two groups: high-albedo (bright minerals) and low-albedo (dark minerals), each shown in contrasting colors across the terrain. This reflects basic spectral segmentation for further analysis."

## 3. PCA and K-Means Clustering

Since the number of pixels and spectral bands is often too high to handle for meaningful interpretation, dimensional reduction and data clustering methods can be useful for grouping data into clusters of spectra based on their spectral similarity which can make further analysis to be easier. While we can directly apply K-Means clustering to the data, this is not usually recommended. Each dimension of our data carries varying levels of information and noise. For high-dimensional data, only a few dimensions typically contain significant information, while others only add noise to the algorithm.

PCA is a dimensionality reduction method that organizes data based on its variability in the data space, corresponding to its information content. It identifies the directions (principal components) where the data varies the most and projects the data onto these axes in descending order of variance. The downside is that the data is transformed into an orthogonal space where the units lose their original physical meaning. In this example, we visualize the first 10 principal components and observe that by the 10th component, there is minimal discriminatory power. Therefore, we reduce the dimensionality from 55 to 10 principal components, preserving the most significant information, and use this result as the input for K-Means clustering.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid 
            path="assets/img/post_4_PCA.png"

            alt="Image of the grid layout showing the first 10 principal component images extracted from the hyperspectral dataset.

The first few PCs show significant structure and contrast, while later PCs appear increasingly noisy and less informative."

<div class="caption">

</div>

The K-Means algorithm clusters data points based on their similarities. It assigns each point to one of K clusters based on its proximity to the cluster centroids, iterating to minimize variance within clusters. Similarities are computed using Euclidean distance, which I explained in a [previous post](https://nasirlukman.github.io/blog/2024/distance/).

K-Means requires the user to define the number of clusters ($$ K $$ ). The elbow method can help determine this, by plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) for various K values. The optimal number of clusters is where the WCSS curve starts to saturate, resembling an elbow. For this dataset, the optimal number of clusters is 3, as shown below:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid 
            path="assets/img/post_4_WCSS.png" 
            class="img-fluid rounded" 
            alt="Image of the line plot showing the elbow method applied to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-Means. The x-axis shows the number of clusters (K) from 1 to 11, and the y-axis shows the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS). A noticeable bend at K=3 indicates the optimal number of clusters for this dataset."

        %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Image 6. WCSS result for cluster values ranging from 1 to 11.
</div>

Using $$ K=3 $$ , we perform clustering, with the results shown below:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid 
            path="assets/img/post_4_cluster_map.png" 
            class="img-fluid rounded" 
            alt="Map displaying K-Means clustering results on PCA-reduced hyperspectral data. Each pixel is colored according to its assigned spectral cluster (total of 3).

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Image 7. K-Mean clustering result from the first 10 principle component of our hyperspectral images.
</div>

We then can transform the pixels back from PCA space to the original data space to examine the average mean spectra of each cluster:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid 
            path="assets/img/post_4_cluster_spectra.png" 
            class="img-fluid rounded" 
            alt="Line graph showing average reflectance spectra for each of the three K-Means clusters. The x-axis represents wavelength in nanometers (2000â2400 nm), and the y-axis shows normalized reflectance values. The curves reveal distinct spectral features among the clusters, helping to distinguish different material types present in the area."

        %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Image 8. Average spectra of each cluster.
</div>

Compared to our initial simple classification by mean albedo, this approach offers more nuance. For instance, the high-albedo reflectance now separates into two distinct spectral shapes, while the low-albedo minerals remain a single cluster. To further refine the low-albedo cluster, we could mask the high-albedo pixels and repeat the process. However, for this example, I am satisfied with these results. At this stage, I observe that the low-albedo cluster has largely featureless spectra (likely consisting of minerals without distinct features in the SWIR range), making further attempt for meaningful subdivision challenging.


## 4. Endmember Extraction and Linear Spectreal Unmixing

Since our average spectra likely represent complex mixtures, it is useful to extract their possible pure spectral shapes. At this stage, we have decided to categorize our image into three distinct classes. We will use the [N-FINDR]() algorithm with $$ n=3 $$  to extract the three purest endmembers from our image. The data distribution in 2D PCA space and the extracted endmember pixels are shown below:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid 
            path="assets/img/post_4_nfindr_plot.png" 
            class="img-fluid rounded" 
            alt="2D PCA scatter plot showing a triangular distribution of hyperspectral data with three red stars at the vertices, indicating the locations of the purest endmember pixels."
        %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Image 9. Data shape in reduced 2 PCA dimension showing clear linear relationship between three endmembers. Red star is the vertex of the triangle which corespond to the purest pixel on the image.
</div>

This is an excellent 2D PCA representation.  The 2D simplex (triangle) is almost perfectly formed, indicating that our entire dataset can be described as a linear combination of three endmember spectra. These endmembers therefore must be the pixel that correspond to the vertices of the triangle. After transforming the extracted endmembers back into the original data space, we observe their pure spectral signatures:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid 
            path="assets/img/post_4_endmember_spectra.png" 
            class="img-fluid rounded" 
            alt="Line graph showing the spectral signatures of three extracted endmembers across the SWIR wavelength range, each representing distinct mineral groups (mica, quartz, and carbonates)."
        %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Image 10. Spectra of the purest pixels (endmembers).
</div>

This is a good point to start naming our classes properly. You could match the spectra to a spectral library using a feature-matching algorithm to identify the mineral spectra most similar to the extracted endmembers. For simplicity, I use broad categorizations. I define the first spectrum as the **Low-Albedo Mineral Group,** likely dominated by plagioclase or mafic minerals, interpreted as part of a volcanic rock complex. The second spectrum corresponds to the **Hydroxyl Mineral Group**, based on its $$ AlOH $$ feature around 2200 nm, likely related to the occurance of white micas or clays, interpreted as part of siliciclastic rocks such as arkose. The third spectrum represents the **Carbonate Mineral Group**, with a $$ CO_3 $$ feature near 2300 nm, likely from calcareous sedimentary rocks like limestone or calcareous sandstone/siltstone.

With our pure endmembers identified, we can perform linear spectral unmixing to estimate their relative abundances. At this stage of analysis, I prefer to not constrain the unmixing result to be strictly sum-to-one since there are still many unknowns. These abundance results are interpreted as *unconstrained abundances*, distinct from *absolute abundances*, which have more physical meaning. Below are the unconstrained abundance maps for each endmember:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid 
            path="assets/img/post_4_unmixing_result.png" 
            class="img-fluid rounded" 
            alt="Three grayscale maps showing the unconstrained abundance distributions of each endmember across the study area, one map per endmember."
        %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Image 11. Unconstrained abundance of the three endmembers.
</div>

Since we are dealing with only three mineral groups, we can assign each abundance to an RGB channel to produce a ternary representation of the unconstrained abundances:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid 
            path="assets/img/post_4_unmixing_result_ternary_with_legend.png" 
            class="img-fluid rounded" 
            alt="Ternary abundance map combining the three endmembers into RGB channels, with a color legend showing how color blends represent relative mineral mixtures."
        %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Image 12. Ternary map of the unconstrained abundance of the three endmembers.
</div>

It is important to note that this ternary representation is purely for visualization and does not strictly correspond to the absolute abundance of each endmember.


## 5. Minimum Wavelength Mapping

Many distinct hyroxyl and carboante minerals can be distinguished based on the subtle difference in the wavelength position of their deepest absorption feature.
Using a method called minimum wavelength mapping, we can detect these subtle shifts and potentially refine our classification to include specific members of the carbonate and hydroxyl mineral groups. The first step is to detect the wavelength of the deepest absorption feature across the entire spectral range.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid 
            path="assets/img/post_4_minwav.png" 
            class="img-fluid rounded" 
            alt="Histogram displaying the distribution of minimum absorption wavelengths across the full spectral range, highlighting multiple peaks for AlOH and COâ features."
        %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Image 13. Minimum wavelength position histogram for the whole spectral range.
</div>

We observe at least three distinct distributions of $$ AlOH $$ absorption features and five distributions of $$ CO_3 $$ absorption features. For the $$ AlOH $$ group, the lowest feature observed at 2195 nm likely corresponds to lithium-rich white mica, such as lepidolite. The other two $$ AlOH $$ features, around 2210 nm and 2220 nm, likely correspond to $$Al$$-rich white mica, such as muscovite, with minor geochemical differences attributed to variations of geochemistry and temperature of the mineral formation.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid 
            path="assets/img/post_4_AlOH_minwav_legend.png" 
            class="img-fluid rounded" 
            alt="Spatial map of minimum wavelength positions for AlOH absorption features, color-coded to distinguish at least three hydroxyl-bearing mineral subgroups."
        %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Image 14. Minimum wavelength map of hydroxile features.
</div>

For the $$ CO_3 $$ group, there is significant variation in the deepest feature wavelengths. Although identifying specific minerals at this stage is challenging, the observed ranges suggest these features are unlikely to correspond to calcite, the most common carbonate mineral. For instance, features around 2335 nm are commonly associated with siderite, 2320 nm with dolomite, and 2305 nm with magnesite.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid 
            path="assets/img/post_4_CO3_minwav_legend.png" 
            class="img-fluid rounded" 
            alt="Spatial map of minimum wavelength positions for COâ absorption features, with color coding representing possible variations in carbonate mineral types."
        %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Image 15. Minimum wavelength map of carbonate features.
</div>

It is essential to note that pinpointing specific minerals requires further analysis. While we cannot yet confirm the mineral species, the variations in these wavelength ranges are likely related to mineralogical differences. Therefore, the spatial distribution of these distinct groups remains valid, even when we are still uncertain with the definitive mineral identifications.


## 6. Further comments

In this post, I demonstrated some typical EDA steps for hyperspectral analysis for geological investigations in an unfamiliar region. These EDA steps serve to familiarize us with the data and provide a solid foundation for further investigation. 

Here we see that SWIR hyperspectral data alone can reveal a wealth of information, even without incorporating additional datasets, prior knowledge of the region, or advanced analysis techniques. However, complementary datasets, such as VNIR and LWIR spectral data, could significantly enhance geological and mineralogical interpretation of the region. Additionally, methods beyond infrared spectrometry, such as gamma-ray spectrometry, offer valuable tools for geological mapping.

In practice, prior knowledge of the study areaâsuch as geological maps or modelsâis often available and can effectively guide the analysis. More importantly, incorporating fieldwork data, even from sparse sampling points, is crucial for validating and refining the results.
