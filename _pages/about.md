I'm an Earth scientist - turns to GIS and remote sensing analyst. I have +5 years experience as exploration geologist and now Im pursuing a Master's in Geoinformation and Earth Observation at the University of Twente. My research focuses on a Bayesian approach to spectral unmixing in hyperspectral images, aiming to quantify sub-pixel abundances of specific materials on the images. I'm passionate about applying practical Earth science knowledge with GIS, image analysis, and machine learning to tackle complex geo-problems.
