I'm a geospatial data scientist and remote sensing analyst with expertise in spectral geology, earth systems, environmental monitoring, and advance image analysis. This blog will feature snapshots of my projects, study notes, ideas, and insights, mostly related to remote sensing and earth science. My goal is to make geospatial data science and remote sensing methods more accessible, so they can be applied by a wider stakeholders to tackle complex, real-world problems and enable more informed decision-making.
